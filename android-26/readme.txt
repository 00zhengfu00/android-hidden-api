framework.jar file was combined with android.jar from /<SDK location>/platforms/android-26, where 26 is current API level.

I'm not sure that it will work as intended. If it does not work, please report to us.

Please note: This Jar is only the Android 8.0.0-r4 SDK and Framework (hidden API) collection, does not include such as Telephony, such as separate separate internal API.

========== BACKUP ==========

Original android.jar can be downloaded here
https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-26_r02.zip

Extract the archive and find android.jar
